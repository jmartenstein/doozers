# Coding Agent Orchestration through the OODA Loop

## OODA Thoughts

In the realm of coding agent orchestration, the "Orient" phase of the OODA loop is no longer just a cognitive step; it is the fundamental architectural constraint. While traditional development treats orientation as a human-centric period of "getting up to speed," an agent framework like Doozers weaponizes context as a computational asset. By automating the "Prep" and "Make" cycles, we aren't just speeding up action; we are collapsing the distance between raw observation (issue tracking/code state) and actionable decision-making. The goal is to reach a state of "Nondeterministic Idempotence," where the loop's velocity ensures that even if individual agent actions are messy, the system's rapid orientation and re-orientation toward the desired outcome make success an eventual certainty.

The most surprising conclusion of this paradigm shift is that "Act" becomes the cheapest and most disposable part of the cycle. In a high-velocity OODA environment, code is no longer a precious artifact to be carefully crafted but a hypothesis to be rapidly tested and discarded if it fails to align with the "Oriented" goal. We are moving from "Software Engineering" to "Outcome Engineering," where the orchestration layer acts as a governor that manages the heat of these rapid-fire execution loops. The human's role transitions from a builder of blocks to a designer of the loop itself, fine-tuning the feedback mechanisms that allow the system to self-correct and evolve at a pace that exceeds human cognitive capacity.

Ultimately, the OODA loop in agent orchestration reveals that the bottleneck in modern software is not the speed of typing, but the latency of understanding. By employing personas like "Cary Coder" and "Archie Architect," we are essentially parallelizing the "Orient" phase across different specialized lenses. This creates a multi-layered OODA structure where the system can simultaneously observe the microscopic (syntax and bugs) and the macroscopic (system design and product goals). The Doozers framework is not just a tool for running scripts; it is a mechanism for operating "inside the loop" of the complexity itself, turning the inherent unpredictability of AI into a relentless engine for verified reality.
