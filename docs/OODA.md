# Building with Flow: The OODA Loop in Doozers

Building software used to be about the slow, careful assembly of blocks. But with AI, the game has changed. It's no longer just about the "writing"—it's about the "understanding."

In Doozers, we use a simple cycle called the OODA loop: **Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act.**

### The Magic of Orientation

Most of our time as developers isn't spent typing; it's spent "getting our bearings." We look at a bug, we read the code, and we try to figure out how it all fits together. This is the **Orient** phase.

Doozers is built on the idea that if we can help our AI agents understand the world as well as we do, the rest becomes easy. By giving agents like "Cary Coder" and "Archie Architect" the right context, we're not just making them faster—we're making them smarter. We're closing the gap between seeing a problem and finding the spark of a solution.

### Code as a Conversation

In this new world, code isn't a museum piece; it’s a hypothesis. It’s a way of saying, "Maybe this works?" 

When our agents **Act**, they're testing an idea. If it doesn't work, that's okay! The loop starts over. We observe the result, re-orient, and try again. This rapid-fire rhythm turns the "messiness" of AI into a creative engine. It lets us focus on the *outcome*—the thing we're actually trying to build—rather than getting lost in the weeds of every single line.

### The Human at the Heart

We aren't replacing the builder; we're elevating the designer. Your role moves from manually placing every brick to orchestrating the vision. You’re the one who guides the loop, fine-tuning the goals and watching as the system learns to navigate complexity alongside you.

Doozers is our way of moving at the speed of thought. It’s about turning the unpredictability of creation into a reliable journey toward something great. Let's build something wonderful together.
