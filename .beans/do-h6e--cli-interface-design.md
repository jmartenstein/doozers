Design and implement the user-facing command-line interface for the `dv` tool. This involves creating a set of intuitive commands and flags that allow users to manage and execute tasks efficiently.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The `dv run` command is fully implemented and can trigger the task execution flow.
- [ ] A global `--dry-run` flag is available to simulate actions.
- [ ] Script and persona configuration is easily accessible through the CLI.

### Tasks
- [ ] Implement dv run command
- [ ] Support dry-run flag
- [ ] Configurable script paths
