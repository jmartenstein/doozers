Initialize the Go project structure to provide a solid foundation for the `dv` CLI tool. This includes setting up the Go module, installing necessary dependencies like Cobra, and creating the initial command-line entry point.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Go module `github.com/jmartenstein/doozers` is successfully initialized.
- [ ] Cobra CLI library is added as a project dependency.
- [ ] The `dv` root command is scaffolded and can be executed (e.g., `go run main.go` shows help).

### Tasks
- [ ] Initialize Go module
- [ ] Install Cobra
- [ ] Scaffold dv root command
