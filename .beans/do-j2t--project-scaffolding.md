Initialize the Go project structure to provide a solid foundation for the `dv` CLI tool. This includes setting up the Go module, installing necessary dependencies like Cobra, and creating the initial command-line entry point.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Go module `github.com/jmartenstein/doozers` is successfully initialized.
- [x] Cobra CLI library is added as a project dependency.
- [x] The `dv` root command is scaffolded and can be executed (e.g., `go run main.go` shows help).

### Tasks
- [x] Initialize Go module
- [x] Install Cobra
- [x] Scaffold dv root command

## Summary of Changes\n- Initialized Go module.\n- Installed Cobra CLI framework.\n- Scaffolded the `dv` CLI root command with a `run` placeholder.
